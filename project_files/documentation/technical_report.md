## 1. Data Preparation and Modeling Steps

### 1.1 Data Loading and Initial Exploration

The project uses a customer churn dataset containing user behavior data from a music streaming service. The data includes:

- **User Demographics**: Gender, registration date, subscription level
- **Behavioral Features**: Session counts, event counts, page diversity
- **Content Interaction**: Artist diversity, song diversity, listening patterns
- **Temporal Features**: Days active, average session length

### 1.2 Data Preprocessing Pipeline

#### Temporal Data Splitting
To prevent data leakage, we implemented temporal splitting:
- **Training Set**: Users with registration dates in the first 70% of the time period
- **Test Set**: Users with registration dates in the last 30% of the time period
- **Validation**: Cross-validation within the training set

#### Feature Engineering
Created comprehensive user features:
- **Engagement Metrics**: Events per session, average song length
- **Diversity Metrics**: Page, artist, and song diversity scores
- **Temporal Features**: Days since registration, activity patterns
- **Behavioral Aggregates**: Total sessions, events, listening time

#### Churn Definition
Defined churn as users who:
- Had no activity for 30+ days
- Showed declining engagement patterns
- Demonstrated reduced session frequency

### 1.3 Data Quality Assurance

- **Missing Value Handling**: Imputed missing values with appropriate strategies
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified and handled extreme values in numerical features
- **Feature Scaling**: Applied standardization for numerical features
