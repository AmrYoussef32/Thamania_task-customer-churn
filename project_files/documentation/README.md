## üöß Main Difficulties Encountered

### 1. Data Leakage Prevention

**Challenge**: Traditional random splitting would lead to data leakage in time-series customer data.

**Impact**: Could result in overly optimistic performance estimates and poor real-world performance.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented temporal splitting based on user registration dates
- Created custom `prevent_data_leakage()` method
- Ensured training data only contains users registered before test period
- Added validation to confirm temporal integrity

**Code Example:**
```python
def prevent_data_leakage(self, df):
    # Sort by registration date
    df_sorted = df.sort_values('registration')
    
    # Split temporally (70% train, 30% test)
    split_point = int(len(df_sorted) * 0.7)
    train_data = df_sorted.iloc[:split_point]
    test_data = df_sorted.iloc[split_point:]
    
    return train_data, test_data
```

### 2. Feature Engineering Complexity

**Challenge**: Creating meaningful features from raw behavioral data while maintaining interpretability.

**Impact**: Poor feature engineering could lead to suboptimal model performance.

**Solution**:
- Developed domain-specific feature engineering pipeline
- Created engagement metrics (events per session, diversity scores)
- Implemented temporal features (days active, activity patterns)
- Used feature importance analysis for selection

**Key Features Created:**
- `events_per_session`: Average events per user session
- `page_diversity`: Number of unique pages visited
- `artist_diversity`: Number of unique artists listened to
- `song_diversity`: Number of unique songs played
- `days_active`: Temporal activity patterns

### 3. Class Imbalance

**Challenge**: Churned users represent only ~15% of the dataset, creating severe class imbalance.

**Impact**: Models could achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class.

**Solution**:
- Used F1-score and balanced accuracy as primary metrics
- Implemented class weights in model training
- Applied SMOTE for synthetic minority oversampling
- Used stratified sampling in cross-validation

### 4. Model Deployment and Monitoring

**Challenge**: Creating a production-ready system with automated monitoring and retraining.

**Impact**: Without proper monitoring, model performance could degrade over time.

**Solution**:
- Built FastAPI application for model serving
- Implemented comprehensive monitoring system
- Created automated retraining triggers
- Added drift detection capabilities

### 5. Code Quality and Maintainability

**Challenge**: Ensuring code quality across multiple components and team collaboration.

**Impact**: Poor code quality could lead to bugs, maintenance issues, and deployment problems.

**Solution**:
- Implemented comprehensive linting with Ruff and Black
- Added pre-commit hooks for automated quality checks
- Created modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Established consistent coding standards
